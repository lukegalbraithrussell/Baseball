# Baseball

Hopefully some of this will be useful for people just getting into sabemetrics. Baseball data is my main source of data when testing out new methods, and this is a good way to keep it organized.

Plans:

Section 1: Position Players

1.1 wOBA
1.2 BaseRunning
1.3 Defensive Stats

Section 2: WAR
2.1 Offsensive WAR
2.2 Defensive WAR
2.3 Team WAR
