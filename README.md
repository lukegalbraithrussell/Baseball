Hopefully some of this will be useful for people just getting into sabemetrics. Baseball data is my main source of data when testing out new methods, and this is a good way to keep it organized.

Plans:

Section 1: WAR

1.1 Offensive WAR
1.2 Defensive WAR
1.3 Team WAR

Section 2: Offensive Stats
1.1 wOBA and WRC+
1.2 OPS+
1.3 Baserunning

Section 3: Defensive Stats
1.1 UZR
1.2 DRS
